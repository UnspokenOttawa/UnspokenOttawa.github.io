Title: Testing ARIS 
---

I probably shouldn’t be writing a devlog today, I am in a foul mood. But hey, I played with ARIS today and I didn’t want to punch my computer. This is a good sign. I will, however say, on first glance, the design is not particularly intuitive, nor user friendly. I like its concept for locative storytelling and game play, but I feel like there has to be a better app out there… or really, maybe you just need to design your own.

After much messing around, I start the introduction of the Protestant Orphan Home with a conversation. This conversation with the character the player is seeing this part of the experience through – Mrs. Wilson. She is one intense looking avatar.

My initial recreation to creating a conversation with her and then an event to unlock at a specific location, is that the location toggle to set the parameters for unlocking does not always work. For some reason it wasn’t always coming up. I have no idea, it just wasn’t. So I would reload, press buttons to reset it, and work from there. While this is a fairly minor thing, it is a frustrating thing. 

Now that I have used some class time for ARIS messing around, I am off to create my first storyboard.
