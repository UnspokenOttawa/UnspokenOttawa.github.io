Title: Digital Storytelling
---

In writing the story for my ARIS game, I have tried to make consequences for the player based on their responses. This provided to be a bit more challenging than I anticipated. I had to let go of the idea that not having consequences was unethical, or I had to let go of the historical narrative I was trying to construct in making this game. It was one or the other. 

I went for the unethical. 

Players get to pick the direction of the conversation, but more often than not, it leads to the same, or similar enough, outcomes. The idea is: I am steering someone through a historical process of creating an orphanage. They are only minor agents in the process. I think this is something more akin to these games for high schoolers where all the action is done through conversation but generally speaking, they all have the same prescribed end result. What you can change is fairly minimal. Despite this, it is my hope that in feeling some form of agency, unethical or otherwise, when the person gets the opportunity to talk to a child in the last conversation of the game, it evokes an emotional response. It’s interesting to have them go through all the movements of establishing an orphanage to basically hear about how awful it is at the end. Well. Maybe not awful, but certainly not great, and certainly not the narrative the ladies wanted to leave behind. 

Okay… but why? I guess I wanted to control the narrative. I wanted to perhaps go through the motions of actually getting to make an orphanage, which would suggest that it was a positive thing. Something the formal message tells us, and break it down. The control of the narrative allows me remain accurate to the process, while the fiction in particularly allows me really challenge the narrative by giving voice to two children who challenge the orphanage. I read this great article about the Protestant Orphan Home as part of a larger effort for social control over the lower classes, and I wanted to complicate the idea that helping children is an inherently altruistic act, but can be something else altogether.
