post: But wait, what about the digital?

---

I think it’s fair to say I haven’t written a lot about the digital side of this project. It’s in part because I want my research underway before I tackle the digital, but I don’t think that’s enough to excuse myself from sharing some of the theoretically questions or frameworks I am coming across – albeit little at this time. 

An interesting question was asked in class last week: how does our work in digital history connect to our work as a public historian? Well, like most historians, I consider myself a storyteller. I also consider myself interested in place. When I think of it in those two branches of my interests, I see how ARIS is just one way to wed my role as a historical storyteller and as someone who is interested in place. This is also a nifty opportunity to think about place – something I don’t particularly engage with in my MRE.

 So wait, what does this have to do with my original point? Well, I am beginning to see how this class might be of interest or of value to me. I have an opportunity to think about the histories I am engaging with in a playful and locative manner. On the word play, I would like to pause for a second because of my research subject. When it comes to telling very personal histories, I do run into the challenge where I do not want to cause any compounded harm to traumatic and difficult experiences. It is something that in gamifying history I will need to be conscious and critical of. The positive aspect of this, however, is in gamifying more difficult histories; I can help foster empathic play and relations with people from the past.
