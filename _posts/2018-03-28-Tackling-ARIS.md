Title: Tackling ARIS
---

Step one is now done, I inputted plaques, conversations, events, items, etc. Theoretically, it is now ready to be built into a scene. Mind you, I will confess, I haven’t quite finished the conversation with the orphans because I need to find a more organic way to write it. 

I don’t care for the default “you player” in the conversations. It cannot be changed to be anything other than “you.” And when you want the players to not be themselves, bur rather, Mrs. Wilson, this undeletable thing is useless. But at least it is inconsequential. 

There was also a moment, where I think I forgot to hit save on a couple conversation bubbles, so when I went back into the conversations there were “hello” bubbles when they were previously full text. Note to self – <b><i>hit save</b></i>.

That being said, the more I put this together, the more I can’t help but think I picked the wrong story to tell on this platform. I know. Perhaps I am admitting defeat. The process of thinking about storytelling, place, and game, well, it’s tricky. I’m not sure this was the best choice. 

When I was in Toronto, there was an ARIS game that focused around LGBTQIA history. It hot spotted places with plaques that had information and amazing photographs. Once you read one, another one appeared. I liked this. It wasn’t a game, but it gave me a geographical sense of LGBTQIA history in Toronto. Dope. 

I also peaked at another game produced in the United States, for students in a class: “Serious Game – Domestic Violence.” This game seems very well developed. There are videos, and multiple choice questions (I don’t know how they did that). It looks good. But not only this, because of the videos, it does a great job a simulating the scenario and forcing you to feel empathetic with the women suffering from domestic violence. The video capability would have been a good option for the orphan interaction, had I known any children willing to read a script. 

So in hindsight, what would I do differently? Well. I think it would have been much more interesting to find a rich photographic archive and craft one, like the LGBTQIA Toronto ARIS game, in Ottawa. However, the only Ottawa photography I am very familiar with is Topley, and well… there is nothing guerilla there. Perhaps, it might have been interesting to work with an Indigenous organization in Ottawa, or even to ping major city protests. Actually, now that I write that down – <i>protests</i>. I know a lot of them take a similar route, but it definitely might have been fun to track down those photos and ping some of the larger Ottawa protests, writing little blurbs about each.

A project for another time.
