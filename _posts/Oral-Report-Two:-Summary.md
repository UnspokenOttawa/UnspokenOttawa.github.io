<b>Where I am at: ARIS Quest Update</b>

Oh god. The music. I appreciate the tutorial but the background music is so unnecessary. Almost distracting. The tutorial itself winded up being minorly helpful. Seeing someone else talk about it made me think about what I needed to do to use it properly, but I feel like there should be more to this function. It just doesn’t seem like enough. I will bring this up in class, no doubt, but I am not sure I see the purpose of the quest – or better yet, how to use if effectively. 

<b>What am I doing?</b>

Slowly dying under the pressure of everything else. But seriously. For this class, I am trying to translate some of my research into the first half of the game – having the player establish the creation of the orphanage. The fictional interaction with a resident child will probably happen later this month (aka after Underhill).

<b>What problems have I hit?</b>

I think this question mostly goes back to the quest function. I think I want it to be something that it is not. Or, I just don’t get how the function works within ARIS, which is totally possible. 

<b>What the history?</b>

I think the game platform is truly interesting for historical education – after all, I do discuss historical fiction and empathy learning in my MRE. I suppose it is fair to say I haven’t done a lot of reflecting on this yet. Not hecre anyways. 

I’ve started to read a bit of literature on games and education. <i>Civilization</i> has been the focus of many papers – and while I do like to play, I would like to see some other discussions not around it. That will be my next dive into the literature. I would be interested in reading anything on Europa Universalis – mostly for my own curiosity. 

I’ve looked at some of Jeremiah McCall’s work. He has authored works talking about the role of computer-based games in historical education. McCall himself having been a high school teacher gives him a perspective I sincerely appreciate. 

Interestingly, a link from this blog led me a dev blog on <a href=" http://burdenofcommand.com/building-empathy">“Building Empathy: Turning Code into Complex Characters.”</a> It talks about how they’re thinking and going about building empathetic characters. The simplest take away on building empathetic characters comes from William Bernhardt, which is to give characters a trait or two, which the player is likely to admire. This is something I will have to think about for Mrs. Wilson – making her character more dynamic. But, I also want to ask, do I want Mrs. Wilson to be empathetic? Depending on the answer, how will this change how I write her.

At the end of the game, I would like to prompt, likely through conversation, some self-reflection on the player’s part. I am not entirely sure what that is going to look like, but hopefully I have a better idea within the next week or so.
