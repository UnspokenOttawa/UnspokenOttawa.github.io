Title: <b>The Archive</b>
---

Before I get into the nitty gritty of the digital process, I need to have a good idea of the history and archival materials I am working with. And let me tell you, the process has been a tad disappointing. Unlike other institutions, the City of Ottawa Archive does not have their collection listed in searchable format. I have to email an archivist to do the looking for me. This in it of itself is not a problem, I don’t mind asking for help when I need it, BUT what this does mean, is that another person filters everything I see. It is limited to their searching, and this bothers me. In asking about the Perley Home for Incurables, the archivist returned with documents post-1980. The home has moved and turned into a veteran hospital. This is not what I am looking for. When I pressed further and specified that I was looking for documents pre-1920s, I was hit with this: 

<blockquote>I am checking with one of the archivists regarding some other materials we have about the Perley Hospital. There are some access restrictions with that collection, so I do need to confer with one of my colleagues to determine what we can provide access to from that collection.</blockquote>

I’m okay with that answer, and I am always happy to commit myself to putting in an ATIP request, but I am disappointed that this was not the initial answer. I know the archivist meant nothing by not mentioning it before, and I appreciate their help – I really do, but what if I hadn’t pressed? What if I believed they had nothing? In the mean time, I did find some records about the Perley Home for the Incurables at LAC… I just feel like the city doesn’t want people talking about this. 

I also asked about the Good Shepard’s Magdalene Asylum. The city archives reported to only have a painting of the original building. Turns out these records are likely with the Catholic order than ran the institution, which now resides in Montreal. While I do love a good excuse to go there, I think this institution is out for logistical purposes – and mostly, my sanity.

The biggest success, and one I knew wasn’t going to be an issues, was getting access to the Protest Home for Orphans records. They exist in this beautiful fond that includes all the homes they ran in Ottawa – including a home for old folks. I go Wednesday morning (Feb. 7) to look at them.

This process leaves me two leads. There are other institutions I can ask about, but I think for now, to not overload myself, I am going to focus on these two institutions and work from there.
