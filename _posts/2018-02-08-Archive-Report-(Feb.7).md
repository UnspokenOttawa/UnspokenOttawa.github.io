Title: Archive Report (Feb.7) 

---

Yesterday was an interesting visit to the City of Ottawa Archives. I learned more about the records of the Perley Home and the reason why requesting these documents are such a challenge. Apparently, they have not properly undergone any arrangement and the files go up to twenty years ago. The archivist, working with one of their colleagues, is currently trying to fix this and suggested that looking at the files might require a research agreement to protect individual privacy. I’m glad to hear this was the blockage, but I am curious as to why the documents were never properly organized. 

Now that I know what’s going on with Perley, I can focus on the Protestant Orphan Home. The institutional records are detailed. The women who ran this institution in its first 40 years were detailed and proud of their accomplishment. There is a written history that is very personal done by the acting secretary from 1864 to 1904. This detail would allow me to set up a game in ARIS that starts with an administrative evolution of the Orphan Home. Within the files are issues of fundraising, finding a place, and internal conflict. So far, documents about the inmates have been limited. While I will continue to build from the small bits of information about them, I think I am going to turn to some secondary sources to help build an authentic experience of an orphan in 19th century Ottawa.
