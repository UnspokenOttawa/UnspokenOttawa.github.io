Title: Making a Plan 
---

After spending last class getting a bit more familiar with ARIS, I took some time today to draft out my plan for the Protestant Orphan Home. Because there were far more documents about setting up the Orphanage than documents that gave me insight into the experiences of those who lived there, I will begin the game with the founding of the organization, the fundraising process, and finally, finding a location for the orphan home. The player will experience this all as Mrs. Wilson. 

I think for the fundraising and location search, I am going to look into using the quest functions. But, in all honesty, I look at that function and I don’t get it. I am not sure how it works. Whenever I have run into issues with audio-visual editing, I immediately turn to youtube. It didn’t take long to find a collection of videos that provide a tutorial. The third lesson talks about locations, quests, and media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22y6GmlP-0. I know there is the manual, but I really do prefer to see the function making in action. I will report back once I have watched the video and given a stab at using the quest function – because currently, I am sans headphones in the library and I doubt everyone here wants to know how to use the quest function of ARIS.

Once the player has successful established the orphanage, I will invite them to speak to a fictional character – a child. In reading the annual reports, and secondary material on orphanages in the 19th century, I hope to create a grounded character. But the reality of the character is not what matters most. I want to invite the player to think about what they have done in this game and the ethical dimension of it. It is meant to provoke the player to not only think about the difficulties of setting up the Protestant Orphan Home but the implications of doing so. 

If you are interested, this is the extend of my visual brainstorming:

Unfortunately, I’ve never been much of a drawer.
